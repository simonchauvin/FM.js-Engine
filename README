***************** {FM.js(engine);} *****************

{FM.js(engine);} is a free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.
Entirely built with JavaScript it allows you to build your games and prototypes quickly.
Based on components {FM.js(engine);} can easily be extended through new custom components.
It runs on every modern browser and does not rely on any external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.

How to:

- Just modify the "FMHelloWorld" project that you can find in my repositories here on GitHub and start your game. 
- The "index.html" file features the name of your game as well as the JS files that must be included. 
- The "ExampleProject.js" file is the starting point of your game, just modify the name of the file and there 
you can add assets and choose the screen resolution.
- Documentation will be available soon.

Features:

- Keyboard and mouse input management
- Game states management
- Camera management (viewport, scrolling, culling)
- Optional physics width Box2D (box, circle, gravity, etc.) through the use of components
- Simple collision detection without Box2D through AABB and circle components
- Orthogonal tiles management
- Preloader
- Text, sprites and animated sprites rendering
- Debug information

Current components:

- Box2D box and circle physic component
- AABB and circle components for collision detection without Box2D
- Text renderer
- Sprite renderer
- Animated sprite renderer with multi-rows spritesheet

Future work :

- Simple particles system
- Simple physic components for avoiding Box2D
- Proof the engine for mobile devices
- Input management for touch devices
- Isometric tiles management
