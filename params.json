{"body":"***************** {FM.js(engine);} *****************\r\n\r\n{FM.js(engine);} is a free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.\r\nEntirely built with JavaScript it allows you to build your games and prototypes quickly.\r\nBased on components {FM.js(engine);} can easily be extended through new custom components.\r\nIt runs on every modern browser and does not rely on any external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.\r\n\r\nHow to:\r\n\r\n- Just modify the \"FMHelloWorld\" project that you can find in my repositories here on GitHub and start your game. \r\n- The \"index.html\" file features the name of your game as well as the JS files that must be included. \r\n- The \"ExampleProject.js\" file is the starting point of your game, just modify the name of the file and there \r\nyou can add assets and choose the screen resolution.\r\n- Documentation will be available soon.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Keyboard and mouse input management\r\n- Game states management\r\n- Camera management (viewport, scrolling, culling)\r\n- Optional physics width Box2D (box, circle, gravity, etc.) through the use of components\r\n- Simple collision detection without Box2D through AABB and circle components\r\n- Orthogonal tiles management\r\n- Preloader\r\n- Text, sprites and animated sprites rendering\r\n- Debug information\r\n\r\nCurrent components:\r\n\r\n- Box2D box and circle physic component\r\n- AABB and circle components for collision detection without Box2D\r\n- Text renderer\r\n- Sprite renderer\r\n- Animated sprite renderer with multi-rows spritesheet\r\n\r\nFuture work :\r\n\r\n- Simple particles system\r\n- Simple physic components for avoiding Box2D\r\n- Proof the engine for mobile devices\r\n- Input management for touch devices\r\n- Isometric tiles management\r\n","tagline":"A free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.","note":"Don't delete this file!
