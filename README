***************** {FM.js(engine);} *****************

{FM.js(engine);} is a free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.
Entirely written in JavaScript it allows you to build your games and prototypes quickly.
It runs on every modern browser and does not rely on any external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.

Features:

- Input management (keyboard and mouse)
- Game states management (creation, destroying, switching)
- Camera management (viewport, scrolling, culling)
- Group management
- Physics with AABB and circles (QuadTree for optimization)
- Orthogonal tiles management
- TMX files importer (Tiled Map Editor)
- Texts, simple shapes, sprites and animated sprites management
- Particles!
- Simple pathfinding system
- Assets preloading (possibility of a custom preloader)
- Debug information (collisions, FPS, etc.) (* key to display)
- Fully documentated and readable code


How to:

- Just modify the "FMHelloWorld" project that you can find in my repositories here on GitHub and start your game.
- The "index.html" file features the name of your game as well as the JS files that must be included. It is also the 
starting point of your game, you can add assets and choose the screen resolution.
