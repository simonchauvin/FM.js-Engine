***************** {FM.js(engine);} *****************

{FM.js(engine);} is a free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.
Entirely built with JavaScript it allows you to build your games and prototypes quickly.
It runs on every modern browser and does not rely on any external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.

How to:

- The "index.html" file features the name of your game as well as the JS files that must be included. 
- The "ExampleProject.js" file is the starting point of your game, just modify the name of the file and there 
you can add assets and choose the screen resolution.
- Documentation will be available soon.
