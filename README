***************** {FM.js(engine);} *****************

{FM.js(engine);} is a free and open source 2D game engine for HTML5 developers.
Entirely built with JavaScript it allows you to build your games and prototypes quickly.
Based on components {FM.js(engine);} can easily be extended through new custom components.
It runs on every modern browser and does not rely on any external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.

How to:

- Just modify the "ExampleProject" files and start your game. The "index.html" file features the name of your game as 
well as the JS files that must be included. And the "ExampleProject.js" file is the starting point of your game, just 
modify the name of the file and there you can add assets and choose the screen resolution.
- Documentation will be available soon.

Features:

- Keyboard and mouse input management
- Game states management
- Camera management (viewport, scrolling, culling)
- Optional physics width Box2D (box, circle, gravity, etc.) through the use of components
- Simple collision detection without Box2D through AABB and circle components
- Orthogonal tiles management
- Preloader
- Text, sprites and animated sprites rendering
- Debug information

Current components:

- Box2D box and circle physic component
- AABB and circle components for collision detection without Box2D
- Text renderer
- Sprite renderer
- Animated sprite renderer with multi-rows spritesheet

Future work :

- Simple particles system
- Simple physic components for avoiding Box2D
- Proof the engine for mobile devices
- Input management for touch devices
- Isometric tiles management
